"""
IDEA: The agent module acts as the 'human in the loop', simulating
of the behaviour of a real-life machine learning engineer.

Because this agent is just a program, it won't read dashboards or anything
like that. It will respond to events (just like everything else does!)

When it sees certain events it will take certain actions. The most common
event+action will be seeing that the fraud model's performance has become
unacceptable, training a new model, and deploying that model to restore
adequate performance.
