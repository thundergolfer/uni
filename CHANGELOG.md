## [0.13.1] - 2019-11-25
### Fixed
- Fix potential `StackOverflowError` for regular expressions used in the
  inline parser (e.g. when parsing long HTML), thanks @lehvolk

## [0.13.0] - 2019-07-15
### Added
- `LinkReferenceDefinition` nodes are now part of the document (not
  rendered by default).
- `InlineParserContext.getLinkReferenceDefinition` was added to allow
  custom inline parsers to look up definitions for reference links.
### Changed
- Performance improvements compared to previous version:
  - Parsing 7-10% faster
  - HTML rendering 105% faster - or in other words, twice as fast!
- Update to CommonMark spec 0.29 (#156):
  - Change how newlines/spaces are handled in inline code
  - Info strings for tilde code blocks can contain backticks and tildes
  - Allow spaces inside link destinations in pointy brackets
  - Disallow link destination beginning with `<` unless it is inside `<..>`
  - Disallow unescaped '(' in link title in parens
  - Disallow indenting list item marker by more than 3 spaces
  - No longer treat `<meta>` as a block tag
  - Link reference definitions can now be in setext headings too
- Tables extension: Changes to match GitHub implementation:
  - Escaping now only considers pipe characters when parsing tables:
    `\|` results in a literal `|` instead of a column, everything else
    is passed through to inline parsing.
  - Table body can now contain lazy continuation lines (without `|`).
    An empty line or another block is needed to interrupt the table.
  - For tables without a body, `<tbody>` is no longer rendered in HTML
  - See https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension- for details
- Check non-null arguments early and provide a nicer message
### Fixed
- Fix incorrectly preserving HTML entities when rendering attributes
- Fix pathological case with input `[\\\\...` (a lot of backslashes)
- Fix pathological case with input `[]([]([](...`

## [0.12.1] - 2018-11-13
### Changed
- Speed up parsing significantly: Compared to the previous version, the
  benchmarks show up to 55% faster parsing for both small and large
  documents! (#137, #140)
- Parse backslash followed by unescapable character the same way as
  the reference implementations.
- Build and test on Java 11 as well.
- autolink: Stop URLs at " and \` as well
### Fixed
- Fix tab handling in ATX and Setext headings.

## [0.11.0] - 2018-01-17
### Added
- The extension for tables now also renders to plain text
  (when using a `TextContentRenderer`), thanks @ahjaworski
### Changed
- Add `Automatic-Module-Name` manifest entries so that library can be used
  nicely in Java 9 modules. The module names correspond to the root
  package name: `org.commonmark`, `org.commonmark.ext.autolink`, etc.
- Java 7 is now only supported on a best-effort basis (but it has been
  EOL for quite some time, so yeah)

## [0.10.0] - 2017-09-14
### Added
- Support multiple `DelimiterProcessor` with the same delimiter char as long
  as they have different length, thanks @szeiger
- Add tests for thread-safety and a section to the readme (#83)
### Changed
- Update to CommonMark spec 0.28 (#94):
  - Adapt to changed emphasis parsing rule
  - Allow nested parentheses in inline link destinations
### Fixed
- Fixes for text content rendering, thanks @JinneeJ:
  - Support for mixed lists
  - Fixed that whitespaces between text elements are removed in "stripped" mode.
    For example `**text** and text` had rendered as `textand text`
  - Improved rendering for auto links
- Fix `[\]` being parsed as link label
- Fix `[foo](<\>)` resulting in `\` in href
- Fix multiple of 3 rule for emphasis parsing (see commonmark/cmark#177)
- Fix text node merging when opening/closing delimiters are adjacent (#96)
- autolink: Fix linking of URLs without host, e.g. `http://.` (#99)

## [0.9.0] - 2017-03-03
### Added
- Support restricting which block types are parsed, see `enabledBlockTypes`
  method on `Parser.Builder` (#43), thanks @marksliva, @pivotal-graham-bell and
  @lalunamel. This allows you to disable parsing of e.g. headings, they will
  just be parsed as paragraphs instead.
- Allow customizing the inline parser, see `inlineParserFactory` method on
  `Parser.Builder` (#68), thanks @vreynolds and @lalunamel. Note that this is
  experimental and currently requires using internal classes.
### Changed
- Wrap escaped HTML blocks in a `<p>` tag (#78)
- Add missing `ext-heading-anchor` to `dependencyManagement` in parent pom,
  thanks @drobert 

## [0.8.0] - 2016-12-09
### Changed
- Update to CommonMark spec 0.27 (#73):
  - Treat h2..h6 as HTML blocks well
  - Allow shortcut reference link before open parenthesis (if parenthesis is not
    part of a valid inline link)
- `AttributeProvider.setAttributes` now has an additional `tagName` argument and
  is called for all HTML tags of a block. This allows users to add attributes
  for the `pre` tag of a code block in addition to `code`. Also added attribute
  provider support for additional HTML tags, namely `em`, `strong`, `code` and
  `br`. (#74)
### Fixed
- ext-heading-anchor: Fix IllegalArgumentException on Android (#71)

## [0.7.1] - 2016-10-05
### Added
- Allow to configure prefix/suffix for ID on `HeadingAnchorExtension` (#66),
  thanks @paulthom12345

## [0.7.0] - 2016-09-23
### Added
- Plain text content renderer (#58), thanks to @JinneeJ!
  - Renders a plain text representation of a document instead of HTML, see
    `TextContentRenderer` in core.
  - Extensible in the same way as HTML rendering.
- Heading anchor extension (#26), thanks to @paulthom12345!
  - Adds "id" attribute to heading tags (e.g. `<h1 id="heading">Heading</h1>`),
    useful for linking to sections of a document.
  - ID generation logic can also be used by itself via the `IdGenerator` class.
  - Use class `HeadingAnchorExtension` in artifact `commonmark-ext-heading-anchor`
- Ins (underline) extension (#54), thanks to @pabranch!
  - Enables underlining of text by enclosing it in `++`. It's rendered as an
    `ins` tag in HTML.
  - Use class `InsExtension` in artifact `commonmark-ext-ins`.
### Changed
- `HtmlRenderer` and related classes moved from `org.commonmark.html` to
  `org.commonmark.renderer.html`
- `HtmlRenderer.Builder` no longer takes an `AttributeProvider`, but uses a
  `AttributeProviderFactory` to instantiate a new provider for each rendering.
  Code needs to be changed to create a factory and then return the existing
  provider from its `create` method, similar to node renderers.
- `NodeRendererFactory` was renamed to `HtmlNodeRendererFactory`, same for
  related classes (there's a corresponsing interface for text content rendering)

## [0.6.0] - 2016-07-25
### Added
- Add coverage data to build. Currently at 97 %.
### Changed
- Update to CommonMark spec 0.26 (#55)
  - empty list items can no longer interrupt a paragraph; this resolves an
    ambiguity with setext headers
  - ordered lists can interrupt a paragraph only when beginning with 1
  - the two-blank-lines-breaks-out-of-lists rule has been removed
  - the spec for emphasis and strong emphasis has been refined to give more
    intuitive results in some cases
  - tabs can be used after the # in an ATX header and between the markers in a
    thematic break
- Simplify and speed up brackets processing (links/images)
  - Improves the nested brackets pathological case (e.g. `[[[[a]]]]` with a lot
    of brackets)
  - Also contributed these changes upstream to
    [commonmark.js](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/ann-commonmark-0-26-cmark-0-26-0-commonmark-js-0-26-0/2165)
- Simplify merging of adjacent text nodes
- Extended `DelimiterProcessor` interface so that implementations get more
  information in `getDelimiterUse` and can reject delimiters by returning `0`
  from it. Also rename the methods:
  - `getOpeningDelimiterChar` -> `getOpeningCharacter`
  - `getClosingDelimiterChar` -> `getClosingCharacter`
  - `getMinDelimiterCount` -> `getMinLength`
### Fixed
- Fix max length for link labels (999, not 1000)
- autolink: Stop URLs at more invalid characters, notably '<' and '>'.
  According to RFC 3987, angle brackets are not allowed in URLs, and
  other linkers don't seem to allow them either.

## [0.5.1] - 2016-05-25
### Fixed
- Fix `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` on line after tab (#52)

## [0.5.0] - 2016-04-22

  @chiwanpark 
- Add information about delimiter character and length to delimiter nodes (#10),
  thanks to @pcj
- Make HTML rendering for nodes extensible (#35)
- Add support for asymmetric delimiters (#17):
  `DelimiterProcessor#getDelimiterChar` was split into `getOpeningDelimiterChar`
  and `getClosingDelimiterChar`
### Changed
- Make `AttributeProvider` work for image and table nodes (#31)
- Update to CommonMark spec 0.25:
  - Changes how partially consumed tabs are handled.
- Add Android test project to build so that we won't break Android support
  (#38), thanks to @JinneeJ
- Replace `CustomHtmlRenderer` with `NodeRenderer` which also allows overriding
  rendering for built-in node types (#35)
### Fixed
- Fix blank line after empty list item to terminate list
- Fix nested bullet list indented with mix of tab and spaces (#41), thanks to
  @derari 
- Fix package name in Javadoc, thanks to @jiakuan
- autolink: Treat more special characters as trailing delimiters to not include
  `">`, `"/>` and `");` at the end of URLs
- autolink: Fix unexpected link end with unfinished delimiter pairs in URLs
- autolink: Fix Android incompatibility by not using `java.util.Objects`

## [0.4.1] - 2016-02-11
### Fixed
- Fix problematic regex that doesn't work on some Java versions and Android
- Fix problems with Android (usage of `java.util.Objects`, `StandardCharsets`,
  ProGuard, see #30), thanks to @JinneeJ!
### Changed
- autolink extension: Update to autolink 0.3.0. This stops recognizing
  "abc://foo" within "1abc://foo" as a link

## [0.4.0] - 2016-01-18
### Changed
Update to CommonMark spec 0.24 (#28):
- No longer allow whitespace between link text and link label
- Don't allow whitespace in link destination even with <>
- Don't use whitelist for schemes in autolinks, recognize all 2-32 length
  schemes (see [spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.24/#scheme))
- Allow multi-line content in setext headings

API breaking changes (caused by changes in spec):
- Rename `Header` to `Heading`
- Rename `HorizontalRule` to `ThematicBreak`
- Rename `HtmlTag` to `HtmlInline`
- Replace `MatchedBlockParser#getParagraphStartLine` with `#getParagraphContent`
  that returns the current content if the the matched block is a paragraph
