## [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

I worked on the 1st Print Edition. Unlike a lot of the other books worked on in this monorepo,
the code doesn't follow a chapter-by-chapter structure, as it's not appropriate in this case.

This book covers off two implementations of a programming language called **Lox**, and each gets its
own folder.

* [`jlox`](./jlox) (Java Implementation)
* [`clox`](./clox) (C Implementation)
