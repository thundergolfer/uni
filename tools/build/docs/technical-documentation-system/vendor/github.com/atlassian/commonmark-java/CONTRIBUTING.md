CLA

Atlassian requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement,
known as a CLA. This serves as a record stating that the contributor is
entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project
and is willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works

Prior to accepting your first contribution we ask that you please follow the
appropriate link below to digitally sign the CLA. The Corporate CLA is for those
who are contributing as a member of an organization and the individual CLA is
for those contributing as an individual.
