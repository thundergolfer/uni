> 👑 🌿 💚 — Nim-lang build rules for Bazel

### Overview

[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) is a tool for building and test software and can handle large, multi-language projects at Scale.
This project defines core build rules for [Nim-lang](https://nim-lang.org/) that can be used to build, test, and package Nim-lang projects.

### Rules

* [`nim_library`]() - `coming soon`
* [`nim_binary`]() - `coming soon`

### Getting Started

The `$HOME` environment variable is required by [`choosenim`](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim), so it's worth
putting `build --action_env=HOME` in your `.bazelrc` file to avoid typing it out over and over.
