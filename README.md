---

This documentation system exists to provide a few features that I think are important to great technical documentation:

1. **Code updates and any required changes to relevant documentation can be completed in _one workflow_, a pull request.** 
    * No jumping into [_Confluence_](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) once a pull request is merged.
2. **Code in documentation should _run_.** Any code shown in technical documentation has automated testing for compilation and format.
    * No copy-pasting code from docs and finding a referenced object has been removed/renamed or that there's a missing semicolon. 
3. **Code in documentation should be tested.** Any code functionality shown in technical documentation can be unit or integration tested.
    * No more forgetting to update documentation when you change the behaviour of your code.
    
> **Note:** This documentation system is built to integrate with the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system. ðŸ’šðŸŒ¿ 
    
## Usage

This system acts a pre-processor, taking Markdown documentation files as input, converting special references to code targets into 
'materialised' code blocks and returning Markdown files as output.

During pre-processing, the system can also run tests and other checks on referenced code.

To provide this functionality, **`technical-documentation-system`** exposes the `technical_documents` Bazel rule:

```python
technical_documents(
    name = "foo",
    inputs = ["hello-world.md"],
    references = [
        "//foo/bar",
        "//bee/boo:biz",
    ],
    tests = [
        "//foo/bar:test",
    ],
)
```
