This documentation system exists to provide a few features that I think are important to great technical documentation:

1. **Code updates and any required changes to relevant documentation can be completed in _one workflow_, a pull request.** 
    * No jumping into _Confluence_ once a pull request is merged.
2. **Code in documentation should _run_.** Any code shown in technical documentation has automated testing for compilation and format.
    * No copy-pasting code from docs and finding a referenced object has been removed/renamed or that there's a missing semicolon. 
3. **Code in documentation should be tested.** Any code functionality shown in technical documentation can be unit or integration tested.
    * No more forgetting to update documentation when you change the behaviour of your code.
    
> **Note:** This documentation system is built to integrate with the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system. ðŸ’šðŸŒ¿
